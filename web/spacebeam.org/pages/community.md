Spacebeam is a distributed open-source research & development company that conducts multidisciplinary work on distributed systems, AI and HPC.

Team up with developers, artists, and scientists that spawn network resources where you'll find translated access to new tools and information models.

To achieve our goal we focus on general-purpose strategies that networks learn from experience on different challenges and environments.

**Our Mission**: provide open-source tools for play, work and science!

**Our Goal**: a distributed workspace environment for machines of all ages.

**Our Problem**: StarCraft: Brood War

The game represent a well defined environment with a number of interesting challenges on:

- Information gathering
- Machine reasoning 
- Dealing with uncertainty
- Domain knowledge exploitation

## Simplicity and principles
Simplicity means that the basic principles of your system, the underlying basic principles on which everything is built should be very simple.

- Let it crash.
- Functions are a form of objects.
- Message passing and function calling are analogous.
- Asynchronous message passing is necessary for non-blocking systems.
- Selective receive allow to ignore messages uninteresting now.

## Our open-source process
We use the ZeroMQ C4 process working on Spacebeam, which means that every proposed change is tracked as an issue.

Your can define an issue for a problem and then propose your own patch, or wait for someone else to fix it... you can also come immediately with a patch, and submit that as a pull request, without a separate issue.

An ideal description for an issue goes:

- Problem: (describe the problem here)
- Solution: (describe your solution here)

Please do not create issues for ideas or feature requests.

Come with clear problems and possible solutions.

## Code and documentation

The source code lives at the [Spacebeam](https://github.com/spacebeam) GitHub organization.

The [guide](https://github.com/spacebeam/guide/wiki) explains our environment and the community [website](https://spacebeam.org) links to our work process, read the rules and join the adventure!
