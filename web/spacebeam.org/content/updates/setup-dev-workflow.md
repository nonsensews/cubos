# Setup Dev Workflow

Hi I'm going to go through my customized dev environment and linux workflow (?),

this is mostly for starcraft brood war ofc born of necessity. 

I use vim but I expect autocomplete and go to definitions and a tool that let me move throuth my projet easy and quick

is a great text editor available everywhere that let me customize it to my own needs

I'm by no means a vim expert, this is more like my notes in the continuous process of learning and making my own customized experience.

vim window movements suck by default, I need good movements (explain what does this means).

my goals are built-in language support for Python, Lua, Erlang and C 

avoid the requirement of tools outside those supported languages,

avoid rust or go utilities if possible,

avoid c++ if possible,

introduce debian linux

kek

introduce the starcraft and vim comparation..

- vim plugging manager
- my list of pluggins
- autocompletion
- unit tests
- git integration
- startify menu (?)
- go to definition
- linting (?)
- denite (more than just a fuzzy finder!)
- undotree F5
- dirvish (file finder)
- hotkeys

- mksh
- kitty
- bspwm
- tmux

direction is more important than speed
