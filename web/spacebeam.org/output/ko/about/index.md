Spacebeam is a distributed open-source research & development community that conducts multidisciplinary work on distributed systems, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.

**Our Mission**: provide open-source tools for play, work and science!

**Our Goal**: a distributed workspace environment for machines of all ages.

**Our Problem**: StarCraft: Brood War

The game represent a well defined environment with a number of interesting challenges on:

- Information gathering
- Machine reasoning 
- Dealing with uncertainty
- Domain knowledge exploitation

# Simplicity and principles
Simplicity means that the basic principles of your system, the underlying basic principles on which everything is built should be very simple.

- Let it crash.
- Functions are a form of objects.
- Message passing and function calling are analogous.
- Asynchronous message passing is necessary for non-blocking systems.
- Selective receive allow to ignore messages uninteresting now.

# Community
Team up with artists that spawn network resources where you'll find new tools and information models.

To achieve our goal we focus on general-purpose strategies that networks learn from experience on different challenges and environments.
