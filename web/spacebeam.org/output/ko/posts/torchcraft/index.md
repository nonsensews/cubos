Only meant to explore the TorchCraft Python API, not to build the best bot possible, you should probably approach your own differently!

Welcome to our tutorial for StarCraft: Brood War bots using Linux and the TorchCraft Python API; we will learn to:

1. [Setup the environment](https://spacebeam.org/2020/07/09/how-to-install-torchcraft-and-set-up-a-programming-environment-on-linux/)
2. [Gather resources](https://spacebeam.org/2020/07/10/gather-minerals-train-a-worker-build-a-refinery-and-extract-vespene-gas/)
3. [Train your units](https://spacebeam.org/2020/07/11/8-supply-11-gas-12-rax-14-scout/)
4. [Build your buildings](https://spacebeam.org/2020/07/13/build-a-wall-lings-will-fall/)
5. [Scout the enemy(s)](https://spacebeam.org/2020/07/15/one-in-a-million-repeats-very-often/)
6. Expand on the map
7. Attack and defend

Finally we can test and deploy by:

- Test your bot using bw
- [Join the Torch Up tournament](https://torchup.org/pages/compete/)
