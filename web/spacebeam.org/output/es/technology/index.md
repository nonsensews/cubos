Spacebeam is a distributed open-source research & development community that conducts multidisciplinary work on distributed systems, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.

# Our work process
We use the ZeroMQ C4 process working on Spacebeam, which means that every proposed change is tracked as an issue.

Your can define an issue for a problem and then propose your own patch, or wait for someone else to fix it... you can also come immediately with a patch, and submit that as a pull request, without a separate issue.

An ideal description for an issue goes:

- Problem: (describe the problem here)
- Solution: (describe your solution here)

Please do not create issues for ideas or feature requests.

Come with clear problems and possible solutions.

# Code and documentation

The source code lives at the [Spacebeam](https://github.com/spacebeam) GitHub organization.

The [guide](https://github.com/spacebeam/guide/wiki) explains our environment and the community [website](https://spacebeam.io) links to our work process, read the rules and join the adventure!
