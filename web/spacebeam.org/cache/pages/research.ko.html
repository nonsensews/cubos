<p>Not too long ago the literature of organizations consisted largely of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrors_for_princes">Mirrors for princes</a> and principles of organizations; these were didactic statements which hold on certain situations and aspects of control and behavior, but in a broader sense, the term is also used to cover histories or work aimed at creating patterns for imitation or avoidance.</p>
<p>Today this is no longer the case; knowledge of organizations is incomplete, and perhaps the best we can do at preset is to use it to guide our inquiries about answers rather than as a precise tool to develop them.</p>
<p>On the surface, this shift from positive statements to qualified less precise ones might seem to be a regression, a loss of position.</p>
<p>Actually, it amounts to an enormous step forward. Faith in the existence of a final and ultimate answer has been replaced by a more mature and sophisticate understanding of the factors involved in organizations.</p>
<h1>Goal function</h1>
<p>Determine the relative success or failure of the organization.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://github.com/spacebeam/ophelia">it</a> wins at StarCraft: Brood War, with a system that extract value from information models design for online competition, is a success; if not, it is to that degree unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Goals function as starting point analysis leading to a hierarchy of objectives and to a definition of nodes and units.</p>
<h1>System approach</h1>
<p>This approach does not give prime attention to organizational objectives but to those attributes relevant to any goal.</p>
<p>The systems model consider the organization as receiving inputs from the environment and delivering outputs to it.</p>
<h1>Undecidable decisions</h1>
<p>Information models are used in two ways; one are schemes with central focus goals, deterministic objectives.</p>
<p>The other <code>schemata</code> is the result of system models that focus on organization general properties and processes.</p>
