<p><strong>The migration from Lua 5.2 to 5.3 is very much Work-In-Progress. Please test it but there are as yet no guratantees.</strong></p>
<p>Lua is a lightweight, multi-paradigm, scripting programming language, intended to be a extension designed for embedded use in applications.</p>
<p>It supports procedural, object-oriented, functional, data-driven, reactive, organizational programming and more.</p>
<p>Luerl works as a library embedded in a host simple called the embedding program. The host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua variables, and call Erlang functions by Lua code.</p>
<p>Through the use of Erlang, Luerl can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, creating a customized language sharing a syntactical framework.</p>
