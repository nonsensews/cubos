<p>Luerl is an implementation of standard Lua 5.3 written in Erlang/OTP a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language common in games, IoT, artificial intelligence and scientific computing research.</p>
<p>It supports procedural, object-oriented, functional, data-driven, reactive, organizational programming and data description.</p>
<p>Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program: it works as a library embedded in a host. The host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua variables, and call Erlang functions by Lua code.</p>
<p>The Luerl VM is a mixture of interpreting Lua VM instructions and using Erlang directly to implement function calls.</p>
<p>Through the use of Erlang functions, Luerl can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, creating a customized language sharing a syntactical framework. </p>
<p>Luerl is a library, written in clean Erlang/OTP. For more information, click on the <a href="https://github.com/rvirding/luerl/wiki/0.2-Getting-started">get started</a> tutorial.

<h2>Luerl goal</h2>
<p>A proper implementation of the Lua language</p>
<ul>
<li>It SHOULD look and behave the same as Lua</li>
<li>It SHOULD include the Lua standard libraries</li>
<li>It MUST interface well with Erlang/OTP</li>
</ul>
<h2>The result</h2>
<p>Luerl is a native Erlang implementation of standard Lua 5.3 written for the BEAM ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy for Erlang to call</li>
<li>Easy for Lua to call Erlang</li>
<li>Erlang concurrency model and error handling</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the use of Erlang/OTP, Luerl can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, creating
a customized language sharing a syntactical framework.</p>
