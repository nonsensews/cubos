<p>Spacebeam is a distributed open-source research &amp; development company that conducts multidisciplinary work on distributed systems, AI and HPC.</p>
<p>Team up with developers, artists, and scientists that spawn network resources where you'll find translated access to new tools and information models.</p>
<p>To achieve our goal we focus on general-purpose strategies that networks learn from experience on different challenges and environments.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong>: provide open-source tools for play, work and science!</p>
<p><strong>Our Goal</strong>: a distributed workspace environment for machines of all ages.</p>
<p><strong>Our Problem</strong>: StarCraft: Brood War</p>
<p>The game represent a well defined environment with a number of interesting challenges on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information gathering</li>
<li>Machine reasoning </li>
<li>Dealing with uncertainty</li>
<li>Domain knowledge exploitation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simplicity and principles</h2>
<p>Simplicity means that the basic principles of your system, the underlying basic principles on which everything is built should be very simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let it crash.</li>
<li>Functions are a form of objects.</li>
<li>Message passing and function calling are analogous.</li>
<li>Asynchronous message passing is necessary for non-blocking systems.</li>
<li>Selective receive allow to ignore messages uninteresting now.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our open-source process</h2>
<p>We use the ZeroMQ C4 process working on Spacebeam, which means that every proposed change is tracked as an issue.</p>
<p>Your can define an issue for a problem and then propose your own patch, or wait for someone else to fix it... you can also come immediately with a patch, and submit that as a pull request, without a separate issue.</p>
<p>An ideal description for an issue goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem: (describe the problem here)</li>
<li>Solution: (describe your solution here)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please do not create issues for ideas or feature requests.</p>
<p>Come with clear problems and possible solutions.</p>
