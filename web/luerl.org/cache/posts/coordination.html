<p>Division of work, being concerned with the allocation of activities in order to achieve economies of effort, does not automatically provide for coordination.</p>
<p>The needs and facilitation of coordination is seen as being influenced by two principal items:</p>
<ol>
<li>the degree and type of division of work</li>
<li>the environment of the organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>To satisfy this need two principal types of coordination are used:</p>
<ol>
<li>coordination by plan wherein long-term, fixed plans and schedules are used</li>
<li>coordination by feedback, where provisions are made for the flow of information about the work being coordinated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Coordination is seen as the task of facilitation linked activities.</p>
<p>The process has two fundamental elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>determination of adequate programs for these activities</li>
<li>communication to signal what program is to be used or the conditions for which a program is necessary and when action is needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Faced with a need for action, an individual might have a range of conditions to contend with in selecting a program; from those where programs are available, complete, and detailed to those where a program will have to be developed either through searching somewhere else for it, adapting an existing one, or creating a new one.</p>
<p>Communications are seen to have a wide range of forms from the specific, precise instruction or order, to the general information about the state of the organization and its environment.</p>
<p>The existence of these wide variations and the basic elements of coordination suggest the need for multiple means of achieving coordination from which the most acceptable element or a combination of them can be chosen.</p>
<p>The essential task in providing coordination is to find the best combination of these possibilities that can satisfy the coordinative needs of the organization.</p>
<p>Coordination is essentially an organizational problem. The extend and magnitude of the coordinative task is substantially influenced by other organizational decisions.</p>
<p>The task itself can be accomplished by a number of combinations of several different means.</p>
