title: Elements of Coordination
type: text</p>
<hr>
<p>In a crude way division of work is breaking a goal into smaller tasks.</p>
<p>Division of work is concerned with breaking a big task into smaller ones. The resulting activities are therefore interconnected or linked.</p>
<p>Coordination is the process of facilitation these linked activities.</p>
<h2>Linked Actions</h2>
<p>On an assembly line a worker often picks up a part, does some work on it, and lays it down when finishes.</p>
<p>The next worker, seeing the part laid down knowns that it is now ready and the time has arrived for him to perform his operation.</p>
<p>One activity leads to another particular one through interaction. Perhaps it could flow through several supervisors or a production control system. The important point is that coordination occurs only when the proper actions are linked.</p>
<h2>Elements in Coordination</h2>
<p>Coordination has two essential elements; the work, tasks, jobs, or activities performed and their timing through a communication process.</p>
