<img src="https://luerl.org/images/luerl.png" align="right" width="200" alt="Luerl">Luerl is an implementation of Lua 5.3 written in Erlang/OTP.

**The migration from Lua 5.2 to 5.3 is very much Work-In-Progress. Please test it but there are as yet no guratantees.**

Lua is a lightweight, multi-paradigm, scripting programming language, intended to be a extension designed for embedded use in applications.

It supports procedural, object-oriented, functional, data-driven, reactive, organizational programming and more.

Luerl works as a library embedded in a host simple called the embedding program. The host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua variables, and call Erlang functions by Lua code.

Through the use of Erlang, Luerl can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, creating a customized language sharing a syntactical framework.

## Online documentation

Luerl is implemented as a library written in Erlang. See the [github wiki page](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl/wiki) for examples & documentation.
